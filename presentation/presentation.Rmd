- In that same period, more than half a million guests have used Airbnb in Berlin.

- Airbnb also reports that the average Berlin host's rating is 4.6 out of 5 stars, and that staying with Airbnb makes guests more likely to return to Berlin.

## Recent Literaure

- *Rents and Zweckentfremdungsverbot:* Schafer et al found that 5,555 residential apartments in Berlin are currently being misused for Airbnb. 

- *But What About The Hotel Industry?* Guttentag estimates that Airbnb sold about 15 million room nights in 2012. Similar to that of Fairfield Inn & Suites or InterContinental, two major hotel brands.

- *Airbnb Messes with Texas:* Zervas et al. found that a 10 percent size increase of the Airbnb market in Texas resulted in a .39 percent decrease in hotel revenue.

## Hypotheses

- *H1:* The higher the Airbnb supply in a given district in Berlin, the greater the negative effect on the hotel industry in that same district.

- *H2:* The Airbnb effect is likely the strongest once it has reached a critical mass.

- *H3:* Since Airbnb's listings are concentrated in districts with low hotel density, the effect of substitution will be more pronounced in those districts.

## Data & Variables

- We collected data from three separate sources, the Statistical Information System Berlin/Brandenburg (SBB), the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the LÃ¤nder (FSO), and *InsideAirbnb.com*.
