## Airbnb in Berlin
- An online apartment sharing platform founded in 2008.

- 20,000+ Berliners hosted more than half a million guests in 2015

- Renting out flats as a source of income has become more and more popular.

## Previous Research
- **Airbnb drives up rent:** @schafer2016misuse found that rent growth is higher in neighbourhoods that have a significant number of misused flats.

- *But What About The Hotel Industry?* @guttentag2015airbnb estimates that Airbnb sold about 15 million room nights in 2012. Similar to that of Fairfield Inn & Suites or InterContinental, two major hotel brands.

- **Evidence from Texas:** @zervas2016rise found that a 10 percent size increase of the Airbnb market in Texas resulted in a .39 percent decrease in hotel revenue.

## Research Question & Hypothesis
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
What is the effect of Airbnb on Hotels in Berlin?

*The higher the Airbnb supply in a given district in Berlin, the greater the negative effect on the hotel industry in that same district.*
</center>

## Data & Variables

Sources: Statistical Information System Berlin/Brandenburg (SBB), the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the LÃ¤nder (FSO), *InsideAirbnb.com*, & Eurostat.

Dependent variable: $${Occupancy Rate}_{it} =  \frac {{Overnight Stays}_{it}}{{Hotel Beds}_{it}*{days}_{t}}$$

| Type of Variable                    | Name |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | 
| **Airbnb Supply**   |  Cumulative sum of new listings| 
| **Dynamic Airbnb Supply**  | Active listings based on reviews |


## Effect of Change in Airbnb Listings on Hotel Occupancy Rates in Berlin (2010 - 2014)
```{r, echo=FALSE}

NID_Subset <- subset(analysis_simple, analysis_simple$month==12)

ggplot(NID_Subset, aes(x=year, y=AB_supply, group=neighbourhood, colour=neighbourhood)) +
    geom_line(alpha=0.7) + 
    labs(x="Year", y="Number of Airbnb Listings") + 
    scale_colour_discrete(name ="Neighbourhood")

```

## Effect of Change in Airbnb Listings on Hotel Occupancy Rates in Berlin (2010 - 2014)
```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(analysis_simple, aes(x=log_ABsupply, y=occup_rate)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="#c0392b") +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black", fill="black") +
    labs(x="Log Number of Airbnb Listings", y="Hotel Occupance Rate")

```

##Regression Model
Fixed Effects (for time and district) to account for unobserved heterogeneity:

> ${\log Occupancy Rate}_{it} = \beta _i * \log AbbSupply_{it} + \beta _j * X' + \tau _i + \varepsilon _{it}$

${X'}$: Control variables (UE rate, average HH income, passengers arriving in Berlin)

${\tau _i}$: Time and district dummies

##Estimation Results
``` {r, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, results = "asis"}

```

## Prelimenary Conclusion

Policy Implications

> (1) Unlike Zervas et al., we did not find a significant negative effect of Airbnb on the hotel industry. 

> (2)
