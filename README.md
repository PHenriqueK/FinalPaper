###Abstract
This paper analyses the impact of Airbnb supply on the hotel industry in Berlin. By using fixed effects strategies we explore this relationship using district-level data for hotel occupancy and Airbnb listing data from 2010 until 2014. When controlling for economic conditions and the increasing popularity of Berlin, we estimate that a ten percent increase in Airbnb supply relates to a .12 percentage point decrease in hotel occupancy rates. Our work provides empirical evidence that Airbnb may be competing with the incumbent hotel industry, but that this effect is so small in Berlin that it has likely gone unnoticed. Future research should further explore the causal effect of Airbnb market entry in different cities and regions. Policymakers should focus on creating a level playing field and a fair legal framework for both hotels and Airbnb hosts.
